SecurePi — Raspberry Pi AI Camera (IMX500) edge security monitor (FlowGuard).

Runs object detection *on the IMX500 sensor* and applies three independent
kinds of logic to the detections:

* **person** — tracked with stable ids, used to associate an owner with a
  nearby unattended object;
* **unattended objects** (backpack, handbag, suitcase) — tracked across
  frames; once the owner leaves, an unattended timer runs and an alert fires
  after a configurable threshold;
* **pests** (rat, mouse) — a *separate* detector with its own confidence
  threshold, confirmation (by duration or by consecutive frames) and alert
  cooldown. Pests never require an owner and never enter the object/owner
  association logic.

Detections are read from the neural-network output tensors carried in the
Picamera2 frame metadata via the IMX500 helper (`get_outputs` +
`convert_inference_coords`) — matching the official Raspberry Pi IMX500 object
detection demo. Runs with a live preview window by default, or fully headless
(`--headless`) for SSH / systemd use. Alert snapshots and a CSV event log are
written under a configurable runtime directory.

Settings come from preset files in the presets/ folder (required):
presets/common.args is applied automatically as the shared base, then the
named preset's overrides, then any command-line flags.
